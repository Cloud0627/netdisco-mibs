CONTRIBUTING - Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We love pull requests from everyone. Even if you feel unable to run the tests
and check MIBs yourself, simply sending us a copy of updated vendor MIBs also
helps.

As well as MIBs, we maintain the SNMP::Info Perl distribution and the
Netdisco network management application. Missing or incorrect device support
in these packages is usually caused by a combination of missing or outdated
MIBs, and missing support in SNMP::Info.

CONTRIBUTING - How To
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The simplest thing to do, but with the longest time to resolve, is to open
an issue in the netdisco-mibs Github project and attach the new MIB files. It
takes a while because one of the developers will need to find time to help.

Or, you could start with the MIB files in a folder, and follow the Updating
MIBs instruction in our wiki. This means all that's left is for the devs to
apply a sanity check, and then the merge is done.

If you fork and clone the git repo, send us a pull request with a comment:

https://github.com/netdisco/netdisco-mibs/compare

At this point you're waiting on us. We may accept the request or suggest
some changes. It helps to let us know about anything you needed to fix in
your branch.

Finally, if in doubt, ask on the mailing list:

https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/snmp-info-users

Many thanks!
